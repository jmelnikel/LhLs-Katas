// Change Calculator
// Create a function calculateChange that when given two numbers, 1)the total of a transaction, and 2)the amount of cash given to the cashier; should return an object which describes the total amount of change for the cashier to give back.

/* Both of these numbers will be represented as whole numbers in cents. Therefore $10 will be represented as 1000.

Valid denominations are as follows:

Twenty dollars
Ten dollars
Five dollars
Two dollars
One dollar
Quarter (25¢)
Dime (10¢)
Nickel (5¢)
Penny (1¢)
*/

const calculateChange = function(total, cash) {
  // Your code here
};

console.log(calculateChange(1787, 2000));
console.log(calculateChange(2623, 4000));
console.log(calculateChange(501, 1000));

// Number Guesser
// Write a function where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end, the number of tries needed should be printed.

// Inputting the same number multiple times should only count as one try. If the user provides an answer which isn't a number, print an error message and do not count this as a try.

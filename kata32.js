// Given the parameters below, write a program so that you can figure out how many total bottles of pop can be redeemed given a customer investment.
// 1) For every two empty bottles, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop.
// 2) For every four bottle caps, you can get one free (full) bottle of pop.
// 3) Each bottle of pop costs $2 to purchase.
